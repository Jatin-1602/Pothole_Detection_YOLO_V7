Each image has one txt file with a single line for each bounding box.
The format of each row is

class_id center_x center_y width height

where fields are space delimited, and the coordinates are normalized from zero to one.

Note: To convert to normalized xywh from pixel values,
divide x (and width) by the image's width and
divide y (and height) by the image's height.



The `data.yaml` file contains configuration values
used by the model to locate images and
map class names to class_id's.
